## 1. Intro
This game is named as "Tom and Jerry Game". The cat (Tom) at the starting point should find the most effective path(that is, the shortest path) to the mouse (Jerry) at the destination. You have to develop your own algorithm to perform the task.

The map consists of 4 components.  
  
🐈 : This is Tom. Tom is located at certain position on the map.  
🐀 : This is Jerry. Jerry is located at certain position on the map.  
⬜ : This is cell. Tom can pass it through.  
🔵 : This is obstacle. Tom has to find path around the obstacle, since he cannot pass it through.  

### 2. Simulation
